Docker: an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Has the ability to package and run an application in a loosely isolated environment.

Image: a read-only with instructions for creating a Docker container.

Container: a runnable instance of a image. By default, a container is relatively well isolated from other containers and its host machine. A container is defined by its image as well as any configuration options you provide to it when you create or start it.

Docker compose: a tool that allows you to define and manage multiple Docker containers simultaneously. With Docker Compose, you can set up, link, and run multiple containers as a single service.

Docker image VS docker compose image:
- when speaking about names, docker compose will automatically give default names to the images while with docker it gotta be done manually
- speaking about network the container created from the image without docker compose will be isolated but with it the container will be connected with other containers.

The benefit of Docker compared to VMs:
-faster startup
-easier portability
-low resource use


SSL/TLS(Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security): standard network protocols that protect internet communication by encrypting data between a user's browser and a website

LEMP(Linux/Enginx/Mysql;MariaDB/PHP): a popular open-source software bundle for hosting dynamic websites

Docker volumes: persistent data stores managed by Dockers and are isolated from the core functionality of the host machine


Bind mount: connects a file(or folder) to a container (easier to check container files and edit them)
